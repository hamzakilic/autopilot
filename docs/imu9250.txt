A Gyroscope gives the values of Angular Velocity (degrees/sec) in the three respective axis (Yaw, Pitch and Roll axes respectively).

But whatever raw value given first by these sensors should be converted to sensible acceleration or angular velocity values by scaling.

InvenSense Data Sheet of MPU-6050 says that we have to use different scaling factors for different ranges of gyro values. I shall explain how to use these scaling factors in the end.

Angular Velocity Limit  |   Sensitivity
----------------------------------------
250º/s                  |    131
500º/s                  |    65.5 
1000º/s                 |    32.8 
2000º/s                 |    16.4
Similarly , for Accelerometer (which gives x,y,z axes acceleration including gravity) the unit used is g (9.81ms2).

Scaling factors for accelerometer values :

Acceleration Limit  |   Sensitivity
----------------------------------------
2g                  |    16,384
4g                  |    8,192  
8g                  |    4,096 
16g                 |    2,048 
Converting the raw data :

required_value=raw_valueproper_sensitivity
For example , in the first data , you got

accel x,y,z: 1944, 368, 15608
gyro x,y,z : -34, -204, -247
Acceleration seems to be in the limit of 2g. So, scaling factor = 16384

implies ax=1944/16384g
Gyro seems to be in the limit of 250ºs. So, scaling factor or sensitivity = 131

implies gyro_value=−34/131degreessec
